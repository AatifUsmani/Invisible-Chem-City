# Data

- **raw/** — Put your CSVs here (sample data is included). For Toronto Chemtrac, see **QUICKSTART.md**.
- **processed/** — Filled by the pipeline (`run_all.py` or the notebooks). Used by `scripts/export_web_data.py` to build the web app’s JSON.

See **QUICKSTART.md** in the project root for how to run the pipeline and use Chemtrac data.
